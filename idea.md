There is this blockchain academy at novaSBE, and we want to create a project to submit and rank all group projects with some kind of voting system. Every submission needs to stake 0.1 ETH (testnet), and users can vote for their favorite projects by staking 0.01 ETH (testnet) per vote. The project with the most votes at the end of the voting period wins a prize which is the money in the prize pool in the smart contract.

look into using https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2 , but tell me if you don't don't want to use it.

We need a web ui (hosted on github pages).


The vibe of the website should be similar to Blockchain Academy Image.jpg overall, with a clean and modern design. The homepage should have a clear call to action for users to submit their projects and vote for their favorites.
